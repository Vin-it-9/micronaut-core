/**
 * An event published when the server has finished writing a response.
 *
 * <p>This event fires at most once per request, regardless of transport
 * (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3), response type (fixed, streaming), or outcome
 * (success, error, client disconnect).</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getBytesWritten()} value represents the number of
 * response body bytes handed to the network layer after content encoding
 * and compression, excluding HTTP headers and protocol framing. This is
 * the semantically correct value for transfer and bandwidth accounting.
 * When compression is active, the value reflects the compressed size.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getStatus()} may be {@code null} if the server
 * encountered a fatal error before any response headers were established.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this event fires when the server has finished submitting
 * response data to the network layer. It does not guarantee that the
 * client has received or acknowledged the data.</p>
 *
 * <p>Listeners are invoked on the thread the server selects for request handling, which with the
 * default {@code micronaut.server.thread-selection} ({@code MANUAL}, and also with {@code AUTO})
 * is the Netty event loop of the connection. A listener that blocks or does slow work delays every
 * other connection on that event loop. Listeners that need to block must hand off, for example with
 * {@code @Async} on the {@code @EventListener} method, or the server can be configured with
 * {@code micronaut.server.thread-selection=BLOCKING} which moves the listeners (and controllers)
 * off the event loop.</p>
